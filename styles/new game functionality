new game functionality
	 a secret number between 1 and 100 should be generated that the user will have to guess. You should write a named function that takes care of this.

user feedback
	This means that you’ll need to write a named function that takes a user guess and determines which feedback to provide.
	 if a user is 50 or further away from the secret number - ice cold
	 between 30 and 50 - cold
	 between 20 and 30 - warm
	 between 10 and 20 - hot
	 between 1 and 10 - very hot

	 Feedback about the guess should appear in div#feedback. 

 track how many guess the user has made.
 	should appear in span#count (which defaults to 0, when the page loads).

  game should also supply users with a list of the numbers they have guessed so far. 
  	add each guessed number as an <li> to ul#guessList.

  validation of inputs
  	user has supplied a numeric input between 1 and 100.
